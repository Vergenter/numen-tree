find offsets for second state
put columns in place so there is most matches all not mathed are moving candidates
item can have more matches in right column that left opposite cannot be true
The fill from right to left, probably there is chance that this method is incorrect

To well up it more 

Can node be better target for smaller row?



then can simplify this problem to this
I have 10 ranks
And 10 values with 10 scores each for it's rank
find max value.

This is solved


Now we to add higher/lower cost to lefter ones in a way that doesn't influence number of incorrect ones and 
by lexographically smallest I mean
from top to bottom offseted bits must be from smallest indices
If row doesn't matter
but relative height between different tiers matters
by this I mean that offsets for shorter sets matter more than longer
Importance order    
bit_difference_importance, bit_row_size, bit_to_offset

fix rows
